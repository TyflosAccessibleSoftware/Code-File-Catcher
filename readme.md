# Code File Catcher

**Code File Catcher** is a macOS application built with Swift and SwiftUI using the MVVM architecture. Its goal is to help you easily scan the contents of source code files within any folder on your system and generate a readable, exportable summary.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of **Code File Catcher** is to make it easy to collect and share the source code from an entire project or part of it. This is especially useful when interacting with AI assistants like **ChatGPT**, **Gemini**, or other large language models that can provide guidance, review code, detect bugs, or help with refactoring — but require full context to be truly effective.

By using this app, you can:

- Quickly gather relevant code files.
- Create a single, structured text containing all the code.
- Share it with AI tools to get better, more informed answers.

## Features

- Select any folder from your file system.
- Choose one or more file extensions to search for.
- Recursively search the selected folder and its subfolders for matching files.
- Read the content of each matching file.
- Generate a formatted text output.
- Display the generated text within the app’s user interface.
- The app includes options to:
  - Copy the generated text to the clipboard.
  - Export the text to a `.txt` file.

## How to Use

1. Open **Code File Catcher**.
2. Click the button to select a folder.
3. Choose one or more file extensions from the list.
4. Start the search by clicking the "Search" button.
5. Review the generated output in the main window.
6. Use the available buttons to either copy the text to the clipboard or export it to a `.txt` file.

## Requirements

- macOS 13.0 or later
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- Swift 5.9
